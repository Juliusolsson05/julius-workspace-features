 * Inject the extension's stylesheet into this extension view document.

 * WHY the CSS is imported `?inline` and injected by hand: the manifest names JS
 * view entries, not stylesheets. An emitted sibling CSS file has no load hook and
 * silently leaves the view unstyled. Inlining makes each built view self-contained.
 *
 * Idempotent by id: the view can mount and unmount many times per session, and
 * appending a duplicate stylesheet on every open would grow the document
 * unboundedly.
